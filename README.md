## About
These are small, classroom-oriented Python console projects intended to teach basic programming concepts like input/output, control flow, loops, random numbers, and simple animations.

## Projects

### grades.py — Grade Calculator
File: `grades.py`  
Calculate an average grade across multiple subjects with a loading animation and feedback.

Features:
- Input grades for 5 subjects (English, Math, Science, History, Elective)
- Calculates percentage average
- Provides feedback based on performance
- Animated loading spinner

### guessing.py — Number Guessing Game
File: `guessing.py`  
Guess a random number between 1 and 100.

Features:
- Random number generation
- Guess counter
- Hints for higher/lower guesses
- Input validation

### photoCondition.py — Photosynthesis Checker
File: `photoCondition.py`  
Simple simulation/check of photosynthesis activity based on light and CO₂ levels.

Features:
- Environmental condition input
- Biological process simulation and feedback
- Loading animation for effect

### sumDice.py — Dice Sum Simulator
File: `sumDice.py`  
Roll virtual dice until a target sum (2–12) is reached.

Features:
- Choose a target sum between 2 and 12
- Continuous dice rolling until the target is met
- Visual dice roll display
- Loading animation

### trafficLight.py — Traffic Light Simulator
File: `trafficLight.py`  
Simple traffic light response system.

Features:
- Color input recognition
- Driving directions / simple logic based on color

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- No external libraries required (unless some scripts include optional extras)

## How to run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   `cd "c:\Users\sudhi\OneDrive - Cypress_Fairbanks_ISD\csp\new stuff"`
3. Run any script, for example:
   `python grades.py`
